# CarObjectDetection
The project is aimed at identifying the difference between vehicle and non-vehicle in camera captured images in .png format. 

INTRODUCTION:
The technology related to recognizing between two distinct objects in image data is known as Vision Systems. 
We will be using this technology in our project to identify between Vehicles and Non-Vehicles and further the scope for the client to integrate it with GPS in motor vehicles. We can also identify other electric vehicles nearby and decrease the risk of autonomous vehicle moving in way of motor vehicles further on in project if time and budget allows. 
The project is aimed at identifying the difference between vehicle and non-vehicle in camera captured images in .png format. 
The project will provide help in increasing the GPS functionality to distinguish on-coming vehicles and provide clients customer with better awareness of surrounding and prevent accidents. 

DATA SOURCE:
The database is collected from an open-source data repository meant for research purpose. 
http://www.gti.ssr.upm.es/data/Vehicle_database.html 
The database comprises 3425 images of vehicle rears taken from different points of view, and 3900 images extracted from road sequences not containing vehicles. Images are selected to maximize the representativity of the vehicle class, which involves a naturally high variability.
Some images contain the vehicle loosely (some background is also included in the image), while others only contain the vehicle partially. Several instances of a same vehicle are included with different bounding hypotheses. The images have 64x64 and are cropped from sequences of 360x256 pixels recorded in highways of Madrid, Brussels and Turin.

CONCLUSION:
The team has successfully completed the most part of the projects, i. e, object detection between vehicles vs. non-vehicles.
The loss vs. validation graph shows that the model performed well with some exceptions in the starting few epochs of training which is understandable. With increase in the number of epochs the model can certainly perform better but that is out of scope, for now.
The team has successfully made all communications well and good with proper documentation for the client as well as the team, including proper set-up of sharepoint for all team members.
The budgeted hours however were increased than expected, due to minor setbacks in the project duration time.
The visualized data clearly explains the detection of the model between “Predicted that there is vehicle in Image” and “Predicted that there is no vehicle in Image.” which could be used in future recommendations.
